##  Gatsby Data Support

>Data, in Gatsby, refers to information that lives outside of a React component. This data can be stored in various places including markdown files, CSV files, databases and APIs. Gatsby's data layer allows to pull data from these sources into your components.
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and it is used in Gatsby to query data.

Steps to use Gatsby and data:
1. Set up a Gatsby project and install required dependencies.
2. Create components.
3. Query data using GraphQL: After setting up the project, query data using GraphQL.
4. Use static queries: Static queries are a new API introduced in Gatsby v2 that allows non-page components to retrieve data.
